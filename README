local-rc - user-space init scripts for ~/local
=============================================

This is a minimal set of init scripts intended for user-space use on macOS, using launchd and ~/local.
It is designed for users who prefer to manage their own environment without root privileges.

It provides:
  rc           - main init script, run at login
  rc.local     - user-defined daemon startup (e.g. dcron)
  rc.mount     - mounts virtual filesystems (e.g. RAM disk)
  rc.shutdown  - optional logout-time cleanup
  rc.functions - shared utility functions (e.g. timestamp)

Usage:
  1. Place all scripts in ~/local/etc and make them executable.
  2. Create log directories:
       mkdir -p ~/local/var/log
       mkdir -p ~/local/var/spool/cron/{crontabs,cronstamps}
  3. Use provided plist files for launchd:
       ln -s /Users/yourname/local/etc/local.rc.plist /Users/yourname/Library/LaunchAgents/local.rc.plist
       launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/local.rc.plist
     Optionally:
       ln -s /Users/yourname/local/etc/local.rc.shutdown.plist /Users/yourname/Library/LaunchAgents/local.rc.shutdown.plist
       launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/local.rc.shutdown.plist

Notes:
  - All paths must be absolute in plist symlinks. Relative ones will fail.
  - rc.local and rc.shutdown contain example dcron lines. Adjust as needed.
  - Log output: ~/local/var/log/local.rc.out and local.rc.err

This system is simple, readable, and self-contained. There is no install script. Read the code and adapt as needed.
